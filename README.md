# Installation

To get full functionality of the bots design, there are some dependancies on Microsoft Sysinternal Tools https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/ as they provide critical functionality for overcoming windows system account, windows services, and session 0 design. A few of the first setup steps can be considered optional depending on your environment and security concerns.

# Usage

## First Time
